# Time-Series-Forecasting
For the complete Time Series Analysis and Forecasting, all the steps were followed from data selection, exploring and visualizing the series and evaluating predictability, pre-processing of data, partitioning of time series, followed by generating numerous forecasting model, comparing the results of these models and then implementing the best model(s) for forecasting of data for 8 quarters in future, and deriving conclusions.

The methods used for forecasting / model generation were: (a) Seasonal Naive and Naive model (as the base for comparison of accuracy results), (b) Moving Average - Trailing (with 4 different window widths), (c) Advanced Exponential Smoothing using Holt-Winterâ€™s method, (d) Regression with Linear Trend, (e) Regression with Quadratic Trend, (f) Regression with Seasonality, (g) Regression with Linear Trend and Seasonality, (h) Regression with Quadratic Trend and Seasonality and (h) Two-level model of regression model with quadratic trend and seasonality ans AR(3) for residuals. The selection of these models was made based on the merit / demerit of each.

The forecasting results  with MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) being 11.865 and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) as 37.022 for Two-level model of regression model with quadratic trend and seasonality ans AR(3) for residuals.
